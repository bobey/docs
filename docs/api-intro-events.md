The Event API is used to extract clean event details, text descriptions and other data from event pages. Extract data for online and in-person events (a standalone event held within a single day). Support for multi-day, multi-track events, i.e. full conference schedules and festivals, is planned but not yet supported.
 

The full API reference of Events API can be found [here](api-event).
