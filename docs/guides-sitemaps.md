Yes, Crawlbot supports both sitemaps (`sitemap.xml`) or the gzipped equivalent (e.g. `sitemap.xml.gz`) as seed URLs. Crawlbot will pursue all links contained within the sitemap — including other sitemaps — in adherence to any crawl restrictions (patterns, regular expressions, hops or other constraints) that may be in place for your crawl.
