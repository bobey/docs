This part of the documentation contains all the errors you can encounter when using Diffbot's products and currently known issues across the platform. Every known issue will be followed by a table of its progress from report time to resolution so you can keep track of the changes. Subscribe to [our newsletter](https://diffbot.substack.com) to be notified when issues are fixed.

If you encounter an error which is not documented here, or a solution to your error which does not seem to help, please let us know by either opening an issue in our [documentation repository](https://github.com/diffbot/docs) or by contacting [support@diffbot.com](mailto:support@diffbot.com) directly. We're happy to help with any of the following:

* Investigating and providing solutions for issues with Diffbot products or services
* Answering questions about Diffbot product capabilities and behavior
* Providing guidance on best practices for using and integrating with Diffbot services

Note that customers with active subscriptions will receive priority over trial users.
