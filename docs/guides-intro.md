The guides are meant to demonstrate and teach Diffbot's capabilities and features with great specificity. You'll learn how to apply our services to your specific problem and we'll guide you through the process with helpful images, videos, and hopefully clearly written text. As a rule of thumb, any time we encounter the same usage of our services more than once, we'll turn it into a guide for other customers to use. This section will also contain references to the [various errors](guides-errors) you can encounter, and the possible solutions to these errors.

We recommend skimming the sidebar for a title that sounds interesting and starting there. Alternatively, if you know you're interested in the API service, just dive into [Accessing Content Behind A Log-in Wall](guides-api-login). If you want to master the Knowledge Graph, maybe start with [Finding San Francisco's Self-Proclaimed CEOs](guides-kg-ceo).

If you're not sure which service is for you, we invite you to check out the [explainer section](explain-intro) first.
