The Diffbot Analyze API visually analyzes a web page, identifies its "page-type," and determines which Diffbot [extraction API](api-basics-index) (if any) is appropriate. Pages that match a supported extraction API -- articles, discussions, images, products or videos -- **will be automatically extracted** and returned in the Analyze API response.

Pages not currently supported by an extraction API will return "other."

The full API reference of Analyze API can be found [here](api-analyze).
