Welcome to the Diffbot docs! Here you'll learn all about Diffbot's features and how they can help you accomplish your goal.

## Getting Started

To begin, please make sure you've registered for an [API](explain-api) account at [Diffbot.com](https://diffbot.com) - we have two-week trials available which are identical to paid account in almost every way except crawling ability. If you want to test crawls, please [get in touch](mailto:support@diffbot.com) and we'll give you a temporary account boost.

If you'd like to experiment with [Knowledge Graph](explain-kg) (KG), please note that due KG being available only on request at the moment, your trial token will not grant you access to it. Again, if you wish to take it for a spin, please [get in touch](mailto:support@diffbot.com).

## Categories and Sections

The categories are divided into isolated collections of content focused on a specific skill level. Tutorials are good for newbies, but someone who has grasped the basics and knows what they are looking for will feel more at home in the How To Guides, specific solutions to specific problems. If you're interested in the philosophy or technology behind some of the features or choices we at Diffbot have made, there's the Explainers category.

You'll also notice that each category has two sections: API and Knowledge Graph. These are our two main offerings, two rather different products. To learn about each, visit their respective explainer!

- [API explainer](explain-api)
- [Knowledge Graph explainer](explain-kg)

## API Reference

The API reference is separate on purpose. As it's a highly technical section of the documentation, it should enjoy the focus of the reader fully. You'll usually consult it to find out which commands you can run, fields you can include, searches you can run, and so on. It is recommended you dive into the API reference only once you've gone through the prose sections, but if you're technical enough and just want to get your hands dirty, feel free to dive right in!
