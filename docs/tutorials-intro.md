The tutorials are meant to be a gentle introduction into Diffbot's capabilities and features. You'll learn how to use the basic functionality on offer, how to customize it, how to consume data in your own applications, how to get notified of changes and how to search your collection of crawled data, among other things.

While Diffbot seems simple at first glance, the variety of features on offer and their permutations are immense, so we recommend skimming the sidebar for a title that sounds interesting and starting there. Alternatively, just dive into [Your First Scrape](/).

If you're not sure which service is for you, if any at all, we invite you to check out the explainer section first:
