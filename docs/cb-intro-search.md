Diffbot's Search API allows you to search the extracted content of your Diffbot "collections." A collection is a discrete [Crawlbot](cb-basics-cb) or [Bulk job](cb-basics-bulk) output, and includes all of the web pages processed within that job.

In order to search a collection, you must first create that collection using either Crawlbot or the Bulk API. A collection can be searched before a crawl or bulk job is finished.
