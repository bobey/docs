The Article API is used to extract clean article text and other data from news articles, blog posts and other text-heavy pages. Retrieve the full-text, cleaned and [normalized HTML](api-article-html.md), related images and videos, author, [normalized date](explain-article-api-date-normalization), tagsâ€”automatically, from any article on any site.

The full API reference of Article API can be found [here](api-article).
