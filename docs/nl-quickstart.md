The "Entities" tab shows the extracted entities sorted by salience. Click on an entity to see their link to the Diffbot KG and highlight all the mentions to this entity in the text.

The "Facts" tab shows the extracted facts (or statements). Hover over a fact to see the part of the text where this fact was found. See the "Documentation" tab for a list of properties we currently support.

The "Open Extractions" tab shows "schema-free" relationships as described in the text.
