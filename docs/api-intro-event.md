The Event API returns information on an event like a webinar, meetup, etc. and can be used to extract clean event details, text descriptions and other data from  online and in-person event pages for standalone events held within a single day. Most popular event websites are supported, but the Event API is a new release so please make sure to report any bugs you find to [support@diffbot.com](mailto:support@diffbot.com). Support for multi-day, multi-track events, i.e. full conference schedules and festivals, is planned but not yet supported.

The full API reference of Events API can be found [here](api-event).
